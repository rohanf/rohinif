							<p>In a perfect world, our daughter Mihika would have had many friends despite her having special needs (a birth trauma resulting in delayed milestones and challenges.</p>

<p>But that's not really the case. We spent many evenings alone with her having no real friends...though she was very social. She was a lonely child and it was breaking our hearts as parents.</p>

<p>I happened to chance upon a video of a child with a traumatic brain injury benefiting from Animal Assisted Therapy. But this... was in the US. We hadn't heard of any such thing in India.</p>

<p>A series of coincidences led us to Rohini Fernandes. Rohini took a lot of time to explain the pros and cons of keeping a pet. We did a trial session with Cherry, a sweet beagle. Mihika seemed unsure but comfortable enough to try petting and feeding Cherry, gently guided by Rohini. This experience kind of sealed it for us and we launched into the process of getting a therapy dog home.</p>

<p>Fast forward a year and a half and our not-so-perfect world seems all that much more perfect with Bonnie our beautiful Golden Retriever. Our daughter and Bonnie have formed such a wonderful bond and we cannot imagine our lives without our naughty furbaby spreading her joy with every tail wag. She has changed the dynamics of our home and family in such a positive way.</p>

<p>Thank you Rohini for guiding us so patiently through our barrage of questions. Your training and guidance has been invaluable to us. Your depth of knowledge in this field is immense. We need more and more of the magic you do for people with unique needs through Animal Angels Foundation.</p>

                            							<p>When I first got my lil Muffin home she was just about 4 months and like all pups was very naughty and difficult to control. That's when I was looking for help ...and a friend recommendedd me to contact Rohini. It was a blessing for me to get someone like Rohini to train Muffin and at the same time pass on so much of vital informationn on how to bring up Muffin and also take care of her daily</p>
                            <p>At first I was a bit hesitant to go ahead with the training but after a few day once the training begun I immediatelyy began to see changes in Muffin's behavior. And till now Muffin continues to obey every command taught to her</p>
                            <p>I would genuinely recommend anyone to go ahead with getting their Dogs trained by Rohini, you will only realize the benefits of it once you see your pet obeys you. And she is also available whenever you need help with other queries.</p>
                            <p>If you wish to give your Dog the best don't think twice just contact Rohini Fernandes I bet you won't regret.</p>

							<p>With Rohini's help we were able to control our 3 year old furbaby's intolerance for children and strangers. She is calmer now and is easy to take for walks in the evening when kids are playing or older people are walking around.</p>

<p>Rohini had only one session with Coco and she understood her problem and fixed it.</p>

							<p>Pesto is our first dog and we had no clue about what to expect with him when we got him home. It didn't help that one of us was scared of dogs (a spur of the moment decision). Pesto is possibly one of the most boisterous, hyper-energetic dogs you will ever meet. He also has an alpha male dominant streak in him, which made it difficult for us to control or connect with him. When we first met Rohini (she was highly recommended by two non-connected people), we were honestly nervous and unsure if anything could possibly change Pesto.</p>

<p>Truth is, we were looking at it the wrong way. The beauty about Rohini's program is that she doesn't train the pet, she trains you to understand, communicate and behave with the pet. In short, it is 'magic'. Rohini patiently explained us the logic and psychology behind Pesto's every move. She helped us understand the specie he belonged to and the fact that it was a mutually accepting relationship - for pesto to accept humans and for us to accept him as a dog.</p>
<p>Pesto's energy levels only increased with age, but her training helped us understand why he showed unwanted behaviour sometimes, and taught us when & how to correct him the 'dog way'. Her training is structured, thought through and logical. She has helped us journey from the early days of cluelessness towards having a fulfilling relationship with our pet.</p>
<p>Rohini with her extensive experience and approachability is a knowledge bank on animal behaviour and will always be our go to person, for training, for doubts or simply to share the latest exploits of Pesto! We strongly recommend her services!</p>

							<p>I started training my puppy Lexi since she was 2 months old with Rohini. Her method is simple and effective with no treats involved.</p>

							<p>She trains the pet parent more than she trains the dog. Lexi is 8 months now, and I still call Rohini once in a way for any any problems. She has always answered my calls, given me a complete workable solution that can be implemented almost immediately and also given me enough insight on Lexi's behaviour.</p>

							<p>Lexi is well behaved, listens to my commands, and can taken everywhere. Rohini as a trainer is as important for your dog as food and vaccinations.</p>

							<p>Rohini has been instrumental in helping us manage our adopted cocker spaniel Audi's chronic anxiety.</p>

							<p> In just two sittings, she was able to connect with Audi, calm her and teach us how to control and manage an anxious dog. Rohini has shown that you can, after all, teach an old dog new tricks.</p>

							<p>Aslan, our 2-year old Golden Retriever, is a goofy furball who is overeager to love, lick, play and make everyone he meets happy in general. Adorable as that is, not everyone is okay with a dog jumping on them.</p>

<p>Rohini taught us just the right ways to rein in his energy and control him when someone new is visiting or we are outside on a walk. He now mingles with the kids in our building without us having to worry about him hurting someone!</p>


                            <p>The “no out” command has been particularly helpful as we no longer have to worry about him dashing out whenever he sees an open door. Also, we have established the kitchen as an area that is out of bounds for him, so people who are not comfortable can step into the kitchen till his initial excitement is gone. Now he does not go into the kitchen even if his toy goes in there, and even though there is no door!</p>

                            <p>What I love best about Rohini’s way of training is that she gives every pup the required time to learn each command, so that we can move onto the next only when the dog has learnt the previous one well — something I have not seen a lot of other trainers do.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot, Rohini. We are so glad that we found you to train Aslan. We hope he can serve as a therapy dog someday. For now, he is spreading the love, one ‘human’ at a time :)</p>

                            <p>My journey with Rohini Fernandes</p>
							<p>I was never an animal lover, it's just that my son wanted one real bad and that's when we decided to meet with Rohini.</p>
                            <p>I still remember the day when my hubby, son and I met Rohini for the first time at her place for a puppy selection consult. Before I rang her door bell I told my hubby that whatever she says, we will go in for a small lap dog like a shih tzu -- less work, not to much exercise, no tugging on a leash. But after sitting down and asking the weirdest of questions for 2 full hours, I decided to go in for a golden retriever.</p>
                            <p>Gosh!! Can u imagine? From a small size dog to a big one?! Now that I think back I am sure she must be facing these same standard boring questions a number of times. But not once did she hurry into the conversation.</p>
                            <p>I got my golden  retriever Zara on October 10th, 2015 and after 3 days of having her, we started our training with Rohini.</p>
                            <p>Every training session was a magic show for me! There was magic in her fingers and her voice. She never gave treats during the training or physically touched the dog to make her do the obedience commands. Just one hand movement along with the verbal command and Zara would understand! Seriously, how is that possible?! But yes, it did happen.</p>
                            <p>The commands were not too many and very simple for us to remember. With every training session passing by I had a better command over my pet. Simple things like: 'I could leave my main door open and rest assured she would not run out' or 'not pull me with the leash while I am walking her' or 'come back to me when she is off-leash playing with the other pets'.</p>
                            <p>Life for me has completely changed from a non-dog lover to a complete pet lover. I definitely cannot think of coming back to an empty home any more.</p>

							<p>Akiraa, our 2 year old Labrador-mix came from a shelter when she was 13 months old and she had many a past-owner negative baggage. She came into our lives with a lot of love and playfulness. However we did not account for the destruction to be a by-product of all the mischief. Every morning my family woke up to a tornado stricken home. There were carpets of newspapers to welcome us home, whenever we went out. We were hoping Akiraa would guard our home, instead every family member had to take to being on guard. We even had a trainer come in to help us train her but that did not work, Akiraa being the smarty-paws used that trainer's treat-training method to eat as many treats as possible!! Mobile-phones, spectacles, my precious novels were just a few of the damaged goods in my home. It was then, we heard of Rohini.</p>
                            <p>All it took was just <i><b>ONE session</b></i> with Rohini to get my girl completely sorted. Rohini made sure she spoke to us a couple of times before the first session to understand Akiraa. I clearly remember that the 1st session took up almost 2 hours because Rohini was making us understand what Akiraa was going through to behave in that manner. Obviously there was no looking back after that. There has been a huge shift in Akiraa's behaviour, she has calmed down. Most importantly she has become extremely loving and caring of every family member. What sets Rohini's Training apart is that she is her being a Canine behaviourist. As pet parents we've benefited the most out of this. We love Akiraa limitlessly and more than we ever imagined. Thus making Rohini, the "R" in our AkiRaa.</p>
                            <p>As for our darling Akiraa, she is a super swimmer and has been chosen to be a therapy dog!!!!</p>

							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>When we got home 2 Labrador puppies (littermates), we were dejected and sad when few trainers told us to return one of them or put one for adoption citing the littermate syndrome. Even on the Internet in most of the forums everyone talked about the littermate syndrome and that it is not advisable to keep two pups from the same litter as pets. It was heartbreaking to part with one pup.</p>
                                <p>That's when we met Rohini and it was she who gave us the positive reassurance to keep both of them. We have been training them under her and both Hiro and Amigo are perfectly fine. They are 1 year 2 months old now.</p>
                                <p>They eat and sleep well play together and are affectionate and loving. They follow all the commands Rohini has taught us. In fact, it is Rohini's, 'Train the family to be the trainer' approach which is unique and we feel we understand dogs more today.</p>
                                <p>We have been training them under Rohini since they were 4 months old. Rohini advises us on their diet which we are following well and they are both healthy.</p>
                                <p>Rohini's work with animal-assisted therapy for special children is indeed noble and praiseworthy. She always responds to all our queries patiently and we feel reassured. She has given us excellent recommendations for all needs of our pets.</p>

                                <p>I have 2 labs out of which one was just 50 days old when we first met. The way she taught him the 'no bite' command would have been simple for her but I was awed.

							<p>Rohini has been the reason my family has our darling golden retriever Chipper. My husband was terrified of dogs and it took a class with Rohini for him to accept our demand for one. Now that we have Chipper with us, all of 10 months old, it seems difficult to imagine life without him. Huge credit goes to Rohini who has trained not just Chipper but also helped us - first time pet owners - to truly enjoy our Chipper. We can now control him very well and give him so much freedom at the same time as he listens so well to us.</p>

							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>My parents are very scared of dogs and the only condition they had when I got my dog, Charlie, was that she be trained and well-behaved. I had gone to Rohini when Charlie was just over three months old to start her training. She was a dominant dog and had a bit of aggressive behaviour. The first thing that Rohini taught me was the No Bite command. During the week after the first training session, my parents and I observed that Charlie was a bit more controllable and would also listen better. Soon he aggression completely disappeared.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Rohini would teach me how train Charlie and it has made a big difference. The training was based on the principles of positive and negative reinforcement. Punishment was never used. I think it helped Charlie learn better because it was all based on the consequences to what she did or didn't do in response to a command. Rohini was very helpful in guiding us and also accommodated our needs and limits.</p>
                            <p>When Charlie first came home, she would boss over everyone, including me. Now,with all the training she's received, she fits very well in with my family and and it's easy to keep a check on her even if she's spoilt rotten by my parents.</p>

							<p>Sam, my lovely golden retriever is now almost 7 years but is still so well behaved. When Sam was around 7 months, his previous trainer referred me to Rohini who was passionate about training dogs. In the first meeting, I was absolutely impressed by her charm & also the positive way she started training my Sam. For the first time I learned that, there is a relationship between pet & owner, a relationship of mutual respect. She helped me to understand Sam's mind, and help Sam to unleash his potential to be a even more loveable dog. Her training method has a strong impact in both of our lives. Rohini, through her training helped me to build up trust & love between us, the same qualities reflects in Sam's behaviour when he meets others human friends or doggy friends. My Prince Charming even won a Personality contest!</p>
                            <p>Rohini also helped Sam to use his mind positively with her agility and trick training sessions. Sam used to feel rejuvenated, always wanted to come back for next session. 
I feel it's very rare, especially in India to find such dedicated trainers. Sam loves his trainer a lot.</p>
                            <p>My Sam was an unpolished Gem, she made him shine, and my life is also shining today with joy ,because of my darling Sam, who is very well behaved, playful & obedient thanks to her.</p>

Never once she has raised her voice even and trust me my lab can get quite a handful at times. We love Rohini for the tender, caring, amazing manner she has demonstrated with my fur baby.</p>

								<p>We visited Rohini once with our 4 year old German Shepherd, Kai. That was the only session we required. The issue was what was previously diagnosed as aggression. Rohini aptly corrected that prognosis and also provided us with a solution that worked Instantly! By instantly, I mean under 5 minutes. Impressed is an understatement in how Rohini was able to remove 3 years of a stressed trait and this has allowed us to really be able to enjoy our dog more. Blind faith in her skill and experience.</p>

						<p>We have 2 indie dogs, Sniffy (female) and Rowdy (male), they have been with us for the past couple of years. In the initial months post adoption, we faced a severe problem with the dogs howling every time we left them alone at home. Came to a point where I was either stranded at home or had to take them everywhere I went.</p>

						<p>A friend suggested we visit Rohini to see if she could help us with this problem. With no exaggeration, it took one consultation with her to completely solve the problem. She explained to us what the issue is, and how we need to handle it. There hasn't been a problem since then, and we really appreciate her help to get us to better understand our dogs and have a great time with them.</p>

								<p>My son Bruno,aone year old male Labrador, is taking training sessions from Rohiniand it is a pleasure to say that it has been a wonderful experience for me as well as my boy. The training sessions are truly motivating for us, as she trains us to teach Bruno the commands. We then practice the commands in different situations and have now got a lot of control over him. Bruno is a well behaved boy in spite of his mischievous nature thanks to her.</p>

						<h3>Anu Vaish<hr class="yellow-line"></h3>

						<p>Our family moved from New York to Mumbai in 2007 and I would often read about Rohini in the newspapers and magazines - about all the wonderful work she was doing in bringing very special dogs to help adults and children, all with their own special needs. I read about the progress many of these individuals had made, some even miraculous. Then one day I had the pleasure of observing her team at a school, as they conducted pet therapy with the students.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="images/testimonials-annu-ace-1.jpg" alt="Annu and Ace" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">
							</div>

							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>I asked them for help to locate a pet appropriate for my son's needs. She kindly agreed, met with my son and understood his needs. In the summer of 2009, she found our amazing angel - Ace, a beautiful golden Labrador pup. I could not believe how perfect Ace was for our family. It was, as if she had customized the animal for us. Shetrained him and taught us how to take care of him as he was the first pet we had ever had. Most impressively, she trained Ace to be a Therapy Dog. He was trained in a very special manner to be a therapy pet.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>As a result of this special training, Ace is the most calm and composed dog I know. He is excited to give love. Ace never barks, never bites, senses who needs him most and will always be found next to that family member. Best of all Ace has a beautiful, silent sibling-like relationship with my son. They roll around and play rough, like friends would.</p>

						<p>My son sometimes pretends to ride him like a horse or may kick him by mistake. Ace does not seem to mind at all and knows exactly when to get out of the way so he is not trampled by him. Ace's therapeutic presence is not just helpful to my son. Amazingly I found my husband - a former 'animal hater' - to benefit from Ace as well. Each day as he returns from a grueling day of work, I find him kneeling at the door, quietly stroking the dog and enjoying every therapeutic moment of it. We love the fact that with help of Rohini we were able to bring home a companion for our special child.</p>

								<p>Getting Simbaa has been one of the better decisions I have taken in life. Simbaa behaves as a perfect therapy dog should. Simbaa doesn't bark, is completely toilet trained, listens to commands of sitting, lying down, staying at a place, being within a particular periphery if asked and till the time he is released, and all the other basics. He is a thorough young, gentle, well behaved boy, shaping up I'm sure, to be a thorough gentleman.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>Simbaa has this uncanny understanding of sensing tension or stress in anyone at home even before it surfaces or becomes evident. The moment Jiyon starts to show unhappiness or aggression Simbaa is completely around Jiyon, either licking his hand or nudging him or jumping on him. It doesn't end there, Jiyon many times continues to be in anger, pulls Simbaa's tongue, ears. The strange part is Simbaa would not move away from Jiyon. He won't even like me holding Jiyon. He would continue to be with him, calming him down.</p>

							<div class="col-md-4">

						</div>

						<p>Rohini, I can never thank you enough. Nothing of this would have been possible if you would not have trained Simbaa, the way you have - Reward vs reprimand in the form of firmness in behaviour, as against reward vs punishment. He listens to us because he loves to, knowing he will be rewarded. He never obeys due to fear. It makes such a huge difference. This was evident when Jet Airways allowed Simbaa to travel with Jiyon in the cabin as a therapy dog. With Simbaa around he was happy, calm and at times more composed than me when I am travelling :)... Jiyon kept patting Simbaa throughout the flight and Simbaa kept lying quietly down, sitting close to Jiyon's feet assuring him everything around is fine. We are blessed we have each other...</p>

						<div class="row">

							<img src="images/testimonials-ranjini-das-gupta-max.jpg" alt="Ranjini Das-Gupta and Max" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">

                                                        <p>Max had come from a home where he was abused, kicked about regularly, fed a handful of mouldy soya beans in the day and was forced to drink water out of the toilet bowl as no water was given to him. From this environment, he came to a home where he was fed chicken and rice and vegetables, had access to clean drinking water at all times and where no one dreamt of beating him up. In short, he was loved. He was a calm, quiet dog and we felt that an angel had joined our family.</p>

                                                        <p>This feeling, however, was short lived - for just about 2 weeks - and after that his personality completely changed. He hated baths and barked viciously at us when we attempted to bathe him. If he was doing something that he shouldn't be, for example chewing my mobile phone, and I told him "No!" that he was not to do it, he would come bounding up to me and jump on me and hold my hand firmly in his mouth.This was definitely not play. He terrorised the maid who had been engaged to look after him while we were at work. He barked at her threateningly. Everyday, I would receive a call in office from a tearful maid - that Max chased her out of the house when she had told not to do something. I would have to come home early from work to deal with the situation.</p>

                                                        <p>One day, she handed in her resignation. The last straw on the camel's back was something like this - she had done the bazaar that evening and had just entered the house when Max jumped on her, spilling all the vegetables on the floor and then he started eating the tomatoes, etc. He then started chasing her. She had tripped on her sari and fallen down and barely managed to escape from the house with him hard at her heels. She would not work for me again. I was devastated - how would I go to work now? My husband was furious about being terrified in his own home and wanted to give Max away. I felt that I could not abandon him under any condition and this was a source of strife with my husband.</p>

                                                        <p>During the morning walk the next day. I confided in my morning walk friends who walked their dogs with me about this situation. They could not believe that the sweet happy go lucky Max whom they saw every day on the walk, could possibly behave like this. They advised me to get in touch with Rohini Fernandes, a psychologist and canine behaviourist who had trained their dogs.</p>

                                                        <p>She was my last hope and I called her. She immediately asked me to come over, bringing Max and my maid with me. I went to her and in the course of one afternoon (around an hour) she transformed my relationship with my dog. She explained to me that Max was a dominant dog personality who was submissive as long as he was in a situation where he was being abused - in his new situation, where no one was beating him up, giving him everything he could possibly want - his true dominant personality emerged and he was trying to control everyone in the house, particularly the person who spent the longest time with him - the maid (which is why Rohini had asked me to bring my maid also with me). She told me that in the dog world, the physically stronger animal was the one who dominated and I had to show him that I was physically stronger than him. She taught me a technique to do this and asked me bring him down on the floor in a submissive position and not give up my hold, till he completely surrendered. I practised this technique 4 or 5 times with him in front of her and Max was a transformed personality. He knew who was boss now! She also taught the maid a method of dealing with him - which was easier than the technique that she had asked me to use. We both came back home brimming with confidence.</p>

                                                        <p>I requested the maid to remain with us for a few more days and see the effect of the training. I taught my husband the technique also. It was miraculous - dominant Max disappeared instantaneously and once again our sweet, gentle dog (the one we had for the first two weeks) was back. The maid also had no problems dealing with him and I could go peacefully to work. He just needed to understand that he was not the boss. Now, he is 7 years old and a wonderfully balanced, sweet dog. No one can believe this story about his initial days with us. And we have Rohini to thank for all this. We are immensely thankful to her - we owe her a debt of gratitude. For the past 7 years, she has been only a telephone call away from me - available to me at all times, no matter how big or small my query is. I continue to consult with her till this day. I now take my second GSD, Simmy, to her for training (she is the second story that I have to tell regarding Rohini's genius). Thank you Rohini for what you have done for us and continue to do!</p>

								<p>I came to Rohini by my sister’s recommendation 7 years ago. Coco my dog was just about 2.5-3 months old. And she was very aggressive for her age. Rohini was very helpful and took time to listen to our questions and help us in every way possible. She taught us how to calm Coco down and tame her aggression, and with regular practices we achieved it. Even now Rohini is just a call away to answer our queries about Coco. She is very informative and helpful.</p>
