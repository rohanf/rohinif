								<p>Are you thinking of buying a pet but not sure if you are ready for an addition to your family? Then a Puppy Selection Consult will make the experience of getting a new pet stress-free. You will be given advice and guidance to help you make the right decision before you decide to get a dog.</p>

								<p>This consult will provide you with all the information you need to make the right choice like choosing the kind of dog that will best meet your family and lifestyle needs, puppy proofing your home, what to expect once the puppy arrives, etc.</p>

						<h3>PawfectPuppy Classes ( 1 and a half months - 6 months )<hr class="yellow-line"></h3>

						<p>Let your puppy start on the right paw by enrolling for PawfectPuppy Classes. The big question for a new pet parent is what age should I start training my baby?</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="images/testimonials-param-simba-1.jpg" alt="Param and Simba" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">
							</div>

							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>The best time to start is as soon as you bring your puppy home. The longer you wait and delay training, your puppy will pick up a lot of unwanted behaviours and then in a few months you will have a whole list of behaviour problems. If you teach him early in life what is acceptable and what is not then it will be easier for you to handle him as he grows up.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>These one-on-one classes are specially designed to get your pup settled down at your home and to make sure they grow into well-behaved, social adults. At PawfectPuppy Classes you will learn how to stop problem behaviours like chewing/biting as well as toilet training. Classes cover basic manners using hand signals as well as verbal cues.</p>

						<p>In addition your dog will also learn not to jump on people, the off command (that will teach him to stay away from guests and other animals that might not be dog-friendly) as well as not eating food that a stranger offers. Time will also be dedicated to covering any individual problems and questions from pet parents in each class.</p>

						<h3>PawfectJunior Classes ( 6 months plus )<hr class="yellow-line"></h3>

						<p>Once your puppy has mastered the basic commands in his puppy classes you then move on to PawfectJunior Classes where you will be teaching your pet more advanced commands.</p>


						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>Your dog will be taught potentially lifesaving commands like coming when called, not running out of open doors/gates and staying away from other dogs/people who might not like him. You will also learn how to control him from a distance if he is off leash and get him to focus on you when there are distractions.</p>

						<h3>PawfectSenior Classes ( 6 months onwards )<hr class="yellow-line"></h3>

								<p>When untrained adolescent and adult dogs get distracted by their environment it gets very difficult to control them. So these classes focus on teaching your dog impulse-control commands. This will include the off command (that will teach him to stay away from guests and other animals that might not be dog-friendly) as well as not eating food that a stranger offers.</p>

						<div class="row">

								<p>In Single Command Classes you can choose to teach your dog only certain commands. These classes are for pet parents who may want to teach their dog one or two specific commands like not running out of open doors/gates, the off command (that will teach him to stay away from guests and other animals that might not be dog-friendly) coming when called, leash walking etc.</p>

						<h3>Smarty Paws ( 6 months onwards )<hr class="yellow-line"></h3>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>If your dog is very energetic and always up to some mischief then you can channel this energy in a positive way through Smarty Paws. These sessions will enable you to teach your dog individual tricks ranging from the simple rollover, saying hi, crawling to the more complex tricks like walking zig-zag and search games.</p>

								<p>Smarty Paws is more than just fun and games. It is designed to give your pet a healthy balance of physical and mental stimulation. Tricks for your dog are mentally stimulating exercises that will allow him to expand his capabilities in a positive way.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="images/services-smarty-paws.jpg" alt="Annu and Ace" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>Teaching your pet in this fun way also strengthens the bond that you share with your pet and increases his desire to learn from you. All of this will ultimately help in improving your pet’s behaviour outside class too. </p>

						<p>Of course the best part is showing off your pet’s intelligence to your family and friends!</p>
