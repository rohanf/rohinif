								<p>Rohini has an uncanny ability to communicate with dogs. Over the past 1.5 years she has trained my nut case Lab with mind blowing success. After getting Joey, I was lucky enough to be guided quickly to Rohini’s expertise. In her typical gentle style she works her magic. Never once she has raised her voice even and trust me my lab can get quite a handful at times. We love Rohini for the tender, caring, amazing manner she has demonstrated with my fur baby.</p>

								<p>We visited Rohini once with our 4 year old German Shepherd, Kai. That was the only session we required. The issue was what was previously diagnosed as aggression. Rohini aptly corrected that prognosis and also provided us with a solution that worked Instantly! By instantly, I mean under 5 minutes. Impressed is an understatement in how Rohini was able to remove 3 years of a stressed trait and this has allowed us to really be able to enjoy our dog more. Blind faith in her skill and experience.</p>

						<h3>Himani Shetty<hr class="yellow-line"></h3>

						<p>We have 2 indie dogs, Sniffy (female) and Rowdy (male), they have been with us for the past couple of years. In the initial months post adoption, we faced a severe problem with the dogs howling every time we left them alone at home. Came to a point where I was either stranded at home or had to take them everywhere I went.</p>

						<img src="images/testimonials-himani-sniffy-rowdy.jpg" alt="HImani, Sniffy and Rowdy" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">

						<p>A friend suggested we visit Rohini to see if she could help us with this problem. With no exaggeration, it took one consultation with her to completely solve the problem. She explained to us what the issue is, and how we need to handle it. There hasn't been a problem since then, and we really appreciate her help to get us to better understand our dogs and have a great time with them.</p>

								<p>My son Bruno,aone year old male Labrador, is taking training sessions from Rohiniand it is a pleasure to say that it has been a wonderful experience for me as well as my boy. The training sessions are truly motivating for us, as she trains us to teach Bruno the commands. We then practice the commands in different situations and have now got a lot of control over him. Bruno is a well behaved boy in spite of his mischievous nature thanks to her.</p>

						<h3>Anu Vaish<hr class="yellow-line"></h3>

						<p>Our family moved from New York to Mumbai in 2007 and I would often read about Rohini in the newspapers and magazines - about all the wonderful work she was doing in bringing very special dogs to help adults and children, all with their own special needs. I read about the progress many of these individuals had made, some even miraculous. Then one day I had the pleasure of observing her team at a school, as they conducted pet therapy with the students.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="images/testimonials-annu-ace-1.jpg" alt="Annu and Ace" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">
							</div>

							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>I asked them for help to locate a pet appropriate for my son's needs. She kindly agreed, met with my son and understood his needs. In the summer of 2009, she found our amazing angel - Ace, a beautiful golden Labrador pup. I could not believe how perfect Ace was for our family. It was, as if she had customized the animal for us. Shetrained him and taught us how to take care of him as he was the first pet we had ever had. Most impressively, she trained Ace to be a Therapy Dog. He was trained in a very special manner to be a therapy pet.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>As a result of this special training, Ace is the most calm and composed dog I know. He is excited to give love. Ace never barks, never bites, senses who needs him most and will always be found next to that family member. Best of all Ace has a beautiful, silent sibling-like relationship with my son. They roll around and play rough, like friends would.</p>

						<p>My son sometimes pretends to ride him like a horse or may kick him by mistake. Ace does not seem to mind at all and knows exactly when to get out of the way so he is not trampled by him. Ace's therapeutic presence is not just helpful to my son. Amazingly I found my husband - a former 'animal hater' - to benefit from Ace as well. Each day as he returns from a grueling day of work, I find him kneeling at the door, quietly stroking the dog and enjoying every therapeutic moment of it. We love the fact that with help of Rohini we were able to bring home a companion for our special child.</p>

							</div>

							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>Getting Simbaa has been one of the better decisions I have taken in life. Simbaa behaves as a perfect therapy dog should. Simbaa doesn't bark, is completely toilet trained, listens to commands of sitting, lying down, staying at a place, being within a particular periphery if asked and till the time he is released, and all the other basics. He is a thorough young, gentle, well behaved boy, shaping up I'm sure, to be a thorough gentleman.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>Simbaa has this uncanny understanding of sensing tension or stress in anyone at home even before it surfaces or becomes evident. The moment Jiyon starts to show unhappiness or aggression Simbaa is completely around Jiyon, either licking his hand or nudging him or jumping on him. It doesn't end there, Jiyon many times continues to be in anger, pulls Simbaa's tongue, ears. The strange part is Simbaa would not move away from Jiyon. He won't even like me holding Jiyon. He would continue to be with him, calming him down.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="images/testimonials-param-simba-2.jpg" alt="Param and Simba" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>Rohini, I can never thank you enough. Nothing of this would have been possible if you would not have trained Simbaa, the way you have - Reward vs reprimand in the form of firmness in behaviour, as against reward vs punishment. He listens to us because he loves to, knowing he will be rewarded. He never obeys due to fear. It makes such a huge difference. This was evident when Jet Airways allowed Simbaa to travel with Jiyon in the cabin as a therapy dog. With Simbaa around he was happy, calm and at times more composed than me when I am travelling :)... Jiyon kept patting Simbaa throughout the flight and Simbaa kept lying quietly down, sitting close to Jiyon's feet assuring him everything around is fine. We are blessed we have each other...</p>

								<p>Rohini has been amazing with training our dog Bobo. She helped us understand his behaviour when he was a puppy and would show us how to get him to respond to commands with love and patience. She has shaped him up to be a great therapy dog. Thanks to her training Bobo is bringing a lot of joy to so many people.</p>

							<li><p>Command of "No" is very well followed.</p></li>

						<div class="row">

							<img src="images/testimonials-ranjini-das-gupta-max.jpg" alt="Ranjini Das-Gupta and Max" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">

                                                        <p>Max had come from a home where he was abused, kicked about regularly, fed a handful of mouldy soya beans in the day and was forced to drink water out of the toilet bowl as no water was given to him. From this environment, he came to a home where he was fed chicken and rice and vegetables, had access to clean drinking water at all times and where no one dreamt of beating him up. In short, he was loved. He was a calm, quiet dog and we felt that an angel had joined our family.</p>

                                                        <p>This feeling, however, was short lived - for just about 2 weeks - and after that his personality completely changed. He hated baths and barked viciously at us when we attempted to bathe him. If he was doing something that he shouldn't be, for example chewing my mobile phone, and I told him "No!" that he was not to do it, he would come bounding up to me and jump on me and hold my hand firmly in his mouth.This was definitely not play. He terrorised the maid who had been engaged to look after him while we were at work. He barked at her threateningly. Everyday, I would receive a call in office from a tearful maid - that Max chased her out of the house when she had told not to do something. I would have to come home early from work to deal with the situation.</p>

                                                        <p>One day, she handed in her resignation. The last straw on the camel's back was something like this - she had done the bazaar that evening and had just entered the house when Max jumped on her, spilling all the vegetables on the floor and then he started eating the tomatoes, etc. He then started chasing her. She had tripped on her sari and fallen down and barely managed to escape from the house with him hard at her heels. She would not work for me again. I was devastated - how would I go to work now? My husband was furious about being terrified in his own home and wanted to give Max away. I felt that I could not abandon him under any condition and this was a source of strife with my husband.</p>

                                                        <p>During the morning walk the next day. I confided in my morning walk friends who walked their dogs with me about this situation. They could not believe that the sweet happy go lucky Max whom they saw every day on the walk, could possibly behave like this. They advised me to get in touch with Rohini Fernandes, a psychologist and canine behaviourist who had trained their dogs.</p>

                                                        <p>She was my last hope and I called her. She immediately asked me to come over, bringing Max and my maid with me. I went to her and in the course of one afternoon (around an hour) she transformed my relationship with my dog. She explained to me that Max was a dominant dog personality who was submissive as long as he was in a situation where he was being abused - in his new situation, where no one was beating him up, giving him everything he could possibly want - his true dominant personality emerged and he was trying to control everyone in the house, particularly the person who spent the longest time with him - the maid (which is why Rohini had asked me to bring my maid also with me). She told me that in the dog world, the physically stronger animal was the one who dominated and I had to show him that I was physically stronger than him. She taught me a technique to do this and asked me bring him down on the floor in a submissive position and not give up my hold, till he completely surrendered. I practised this technique 4 or 5 times with him in front of her and Max was a transformed personality. He knew who was boss now! She also taught the maid a method of dealing with him - which was easier than the technique that she had asked me to use. We both came back home brimming with confidence.</p>

                                                        <p>I requested the maid to remain with us for a few more days and see the effect of the training. I taught my husband the technique also. It was miraculous - dominant Max disappeared instantaneously and once again our sweet, gentle dog (the one we had for the first two weeks) was back. The maid also had no problems dealing with him and I could go peacefully to work. He just needed to understand that he was not the boss. Now, he is 7 years old and a wonderfully balanced, sweet dog. No one can believe this story about his initial days with us. And we have Rohini to thank for all this. We are immensely thankful to her - we owe her a debt of gratitude. For the past 7 years, she has been only a telephone call away from me - available to me at all times, no matter how big or small my query is. I continue to consult with her till this day. I now take my second GSD, Simmy, to her for training (she is the second story that I have to tell regarding Rohini's genius). Thank you Rohini for what you have done for us and continue to do!</p>

								<p>I came to Rohini by my sister’s recommendation 7 years ago. Coco my dog was just about 2.5-3 months old. And she was very aggressive for her age. Rohini was very helpful and took time to listen to our questions and help us in every way possible. She taught us how to calm Coco down and tame her aggression, and with regular practices we achieved it. Even now Rohini is just a call away to answer our queries about Coco. She is very informative and helpful.</p>
